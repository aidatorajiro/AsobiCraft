# Crafting

This mod has a special method of crafting.

To craft an item or a block within this mod, you have to place specific blocks (ingredients), then throw a specific item at a particular position, then pick up the item (an enzyme) at the position.

For example, you can craft the ADBMAL item as such.

First, place eight glass blocks and a water like this:

"place some picture here"

Second, throw a wooden hoe in the water.

Third, dive in the water and pick up the hoe.

After picking up, the blocks will be removed and ADBMAL items will be generated.

For recipes of blocks and items, see ./blocks.md and ./items.md
